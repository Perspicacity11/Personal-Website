                <h3>My career so far</h3>
                <p>
                Iâ€™ve built a portfolio of professional experience, spanning journalism, 
                publishing, activism, research, comms, sales, marketing, tech and operations. It helps me to look at all facets
                of a business challenge or brief, and work out a multidisciplinary approach to tackling it.

                <h3>Software & Systems</h3>
                <p>
                  I've been closely involved in this AI boom, represented by the widespread adoption of LLMs and image generation across new and varied domains. I've extensively tested the full range of available AI systems and even built some of my own, 
                  and I write and advise on the ethical considerations of AI deployment in the creative and other industries.

                <h3>Advocating inclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  Since 2019 I have been championing inclusive policy and
                  process at the highest levels of the UK media and the wider
                  professional economy, with a focus on Trans and non-binary
                  inclusion. I now work in culture change management more broadly, helping my clients to build more inclusive, receptive and dynamic work cultures.

                <h3>My background</h3>
                <p>
                  Raised oldest of three near Southampton, I moved to London
                  to study politics and started working concurrently as
                  an investigative videojournalist. Since then I've been a publisher and a cabaret bartender, a
                  writer and an activist, sold and bought enterprise
                  technology, and worked in (or near) fields ranging from foreign direct
                  investment to the news and entertainment media, advertising
                  and marketing to fashion, fintech and financial markets.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  Most recently I was the global communications team coordinator
                  at the <a href="https://ft.com/"> Financial Times</a> - and
                  global co-chair of the LGBTQ+ employee network Proud FT -
                  until after four years I left the company to pursue a career
                  in software engineering. I did this at the worst possible time,
                  concurrent with the rise of ChatGPT and its consequent effects on the 
                  tech job market, so I've taken the opportunity to merge my interests by looking
                  at the technological ethics of AI, and related issues of equity.
                </p>

            <div class="col-md-4 col-xs-6">
              <div class="feature-about">
                <div class="medium-hexagon hexagon"></div>
                <h3>What I do</h3>
                <p>
                  Nowadays I divide my time between two focuses: equity in the creative industries, and
                  equity in technology.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  On the first: I'm a disabled, LG(B)TQ+ activist and
                  advocate working in the media and marketing industries,
                  currently as co-director of advocacy at
                  <a href="https://www.outvertising.org/"> Outvertising</a> and as strategic adviser 
                  to <a href="https://www.purposeunion.com/"> Purpose Union</a>.
                  While at the Financial Times, I led Proud FT to deliver
                  award-winning work, including the introduction of the
                  paper's first Transgender Inclusion Policy, the most
                  comprehensive of its kind in the sector at the time. I am 
                  variously involved in other working groups, networks and ad
                  hoc projects as well as advising on corporate and creative
                  EDI.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  On the second: I am a graduate of the{" "}
                  <a href="https://makers.tech">Makers Academy</a> software development 
                  programme with IBM and AWS certifications in DevOps and cloud infrastructure design, respectively. 
                  I specialise in JavaScript - primarily across the M.E.R.N. stack - and am
                  comfortable with TypeScript, Ruby, CSS, HTML, and testing
                  frameworks like Cypress and Jest. Currently I am
                  mostly building in Python with a focus on applied AI. My technical interests
                  are in full-stack development, data management, system
                  architecture and information security. 
                  <br></br>
                  More recently I have been working at the intersection
                  of EDI and technology policy, looking at building ethical frameworks around the development and deployment of
                  GenAI technologies in creative and strategic workflows. To that end I also chair Outvertising's AI taskforce.

                <p>
                  In my ProudFT capacity I represented the Financial Times on
                  the board of{" "}
                  <a href="https://intermediauk.co.uk/">IntermediaUK</a>,
                  working with network leads from twenty other major UK media
                  organisations to address the recent groundswell in transphobic
                  reporting.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>I now advise news and media professionals on
                  effective engagement with newsrooms around responsible
                  reporting, free expression and inclusion.

                <h3>Advertising & Marketing</h3>
                <p>
                  I've been involved in adland since joining Outvertising (then
                  PrideAM) in 2018, where I helped launch the second edition of
                  the{" "}
                  <a href="https://www.outvertising.org/outvertising-download">

                  - the authoritative handbook on authentic LGBTQ+
                  representation in advertising. I remain with the organisation
                  as co-director of advocacy, leading OVT's work to reform the advertising
                  ecosystem, and break the supply chains of disinformation that harm minoritised 
                  communities. 
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>I also consult on EDI governance for Purpose Union, and on 
                  inclusive marketing creative for the <a href="https://thedsc.org.uk/"> Diversity Standards Collective.
